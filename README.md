**GATOR-bot:** 
This automated user improves the resources  available for an educational server created with Discord, a popular communication & community platform. The user, or “bot”, provides the ability to make automated reminders, integrate calendar events into the community, and provide students and instructors an automated method to transfer coursework. 

Designed with Java and Discord's API, this project was created in hopes to help fill the needs of teachers and students in the transition to online learning, and create a more personalized experience for teachers and students than compared to what Zoom or Slack offer.

**Key features**: Calendar impementation, issue board tracking, permissions and roles, and assignment creation and submissions.

                 Instructions to Launch
                 ----------------------
                 
1.) Ensure that you are within the root directory (where this ReadMe is located)

2.) Run the shortcut file titled "Launch GatorBot"

3.) When prompted, log into the bot calendar account using the credentials below

    username : gatorBotSWE@gmail.com
    password : albertalligator
    
    NOTE: If these credentials are not used, the bot will not authorize the user

4.) Invite the bot to a discord server using the following link

    Invite : https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=953790567735783464&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands

5.) The bot should now be online on your server, and most functionality will be present!

NOTE: Permission functionalities are hardcoded in this version, thus will not work with newly created servers!


(If any authentication issues occur, delete the tokens directory and re-launch the application)
