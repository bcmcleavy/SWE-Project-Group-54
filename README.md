# SWE-Project-Group-54
**GATOR-bot:** 
This automated user improves the resources  available for an educational server created with Discord, a popular communication & community platform. The user, or “bot”, provides the ability to make automated reminders, integrate calendar events into the community, and provide students and instructors an automated method to transfer coursework. 

Designed with Java and Discord's API, this project was created in hopes to help fill the needs of teachers and students in the transition to online learning, and create a more personalized experience for teachers and students than compared to what Zoom or Slack offer.

**Key features**: Calendar impementation, issue board tracking, permissions and roles, and assignment creation and submissions.
